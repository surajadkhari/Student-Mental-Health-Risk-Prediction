    "About 20% of adults struggle with mental health conditions like ADHD, bipolar disorder, anxiety, or depression. People who are most at risk for mental health issues need to be supported and not left behind in the tech sector, which is marked by a high-stress work environment, long hours, constant availability expectations, and a blending of personal and professional life because of open-source commitments. This can be accomplished by encouraging work-life balance, de-stigmatizing mental health discussions, implementing proactive mental health initiatives, and providing tech workers who are struggling with these issues with support and resources."

    " to look into the relationships between mental health issues and organisational, social, occupational, and demographic factors.  In light of this, the objective is to create a predictive model that can determine if an individual may require medical assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Justification for Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    " Research shows that a person's mental health has a direct effect on how well they perform at work (Paul, M., & Das, S. (2023)).  Furthermore, a database containing hundreds of records gathered from surveys of employees in the technology sector was released by an organisation named Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI).  Respondents to this survey provided details about their workplace.  For instance, details regarding the number of reported employees, gender, company benefits, and whether the individual had previously sought medical attention were reported.\n",
    "\n",
    " Along with the importance of mental health in the workplace, this database creates the primary driving force behind the advancement of this study.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Suggested Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    " The study will be viewed as a classification problem in which it will be determined whether or not a person needs medical assistance based on data gathered from the survey.\n",
    " Based on a limited analysis of the data, it was initially determined that the variable to predict would be \"treatment\" because it indicates whether a person has sought medical attention in the past.  However, it should be noted that this study is merely an approach to the phenomenon under study, with no intention of proving its causality, due to the subjective nature of this self-reported variable (since an individual with mental health issues might not be aware of their illness).\n",
